    <title>OTTERSIDE - Health Disparity in Medical Research</title>
  </head>

      <h1>OTTERSIDE</h1>
      <p>
        OTTERSIDE focuses on the health disparity in the medical research field
        in today’s society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Health disparity is “health differences due to sociocultural,
        behavioral, environmental, and/or health care/system factors according
        to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through research, our team was able to find out that most of the medical
        research is skewed towards certain groups of the population, such as
        specific gender, ethnicity, or race, instead of accurately representing
        the entire population. We wanted to highlight the disparity and allow
        the general population and the researchers to be aware of this
        situation, influencing us to create OTTER SIDE.
